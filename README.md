Implementing Peg Jotto is simple enough to serve as a "bite size" programming project for learning a language
(in this case, Python) a bit better, while still involved enough to provide lots of opportunities to try out
new implementation techniques.

Implementing Jotto would also be interesting, but for now, this simpler project suffices.

# PegSolitare

Another peg-based game!
Wikipedia has [a nice overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire), but for in-depth analysis, find a copy of John Beasley's 1985 "The Ins and Outs of Peg Solitaire".
